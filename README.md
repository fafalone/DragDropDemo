# DragDropDemo v2.1

(Project update: V2.1 updates to use Coclass syntax, requires twinBASIC Beta 167 or newer)
(Project update: V2 fixes incorrect IEnumSTATDATA definition, and since LongLong can be used on both x86 and x64, ditches the separate definitions in favor of using LongLong+CopyMemory on both)

A while back I posted this project:

[[VB6] Register any control as a drop target that shows the Explorer drag image](https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?808125-VB6-Register-any-control-as-a-drop-target-that-shows-the-Explorer-drag-image)

I wanted to try my hand at using these interfaces in x64 apps. A 64-bit version of oleexp doesn't seem likely; there's seemingly insurmountable barriers to using midl with a project that needs to redefine things in the force-included headers, and the original types weren't preserved so every single interface would have to be manually reviewed and updated if it uses pointer types. But, twinBASIC lets you define interfaces as a native language feature. So I set about re-implementing all the necessary ones for this project:

```

    Sub DragLeave()
    Sub DragOver(ppt As POINT, ByVal dwEffect As DROPEFFECTS)

I used functions for some to preserve as much compatibility as possible with oleexp-using code.

There were a couple tricky things here... it's always been an odd interface. Normally, UDTs as [in] are ByRef; MSDN lists the x,y coords as POINT, and we had to expand that to 2 ByVal Long's in x86. It's even weirder in x64; we have to use a single member, but it's also ByVal... so it's 8 bytes but not *actually* a pointer, so it's handled like this:

```
#If Win64 Then
Private Sub IDropTarget_DragEnter(ByVal pDataObj As DragDropDemo.IDataObject, ByVal grfKeyState As Long, ByVal pt As LongPtr, pdwEffect As DragDropDemo.DROPEFFECTS)
    Dim ptt As DragDropDemo.POINT
    CopyMemory ptt, pt, LenB(ptt)
#Else
Private Sub IDropTarget_DragEnter(ByVal pDataObj As DragDropDemo.IDataObject, ByVal grfKeyState As Long, ByVal ptX As Long, ByVal ptY As Long, pdwEffect As DragDropDemo.DROPEFFECTS)
    Dim ptt As DragDropDemo.POINT
    ptt.x = ptX: ptt.y = ptY
#End If
```

Also, lots of things are fully qualified as there's currently an issue with conflicting types in the WinNativeForms package that are exposed to users.

But besides those quirks, the code works on x64 without major change, just updating to LongPtr where needed, and replacing the PictureBox with a Frame until that's available.

### Requirements

Thanks to twinBASIC developer Wayne Phillips for his help getting this working, and of course for the continuing great work on twinBASIC itself :thumb:
